# Facility Flow
* for HackSMU
<br>
(this xcode project was essentially to test out CreateML and CoreML but i ended up coding it all on here)

## How to Deploy
Click on the green "code" button -> Click "Open with XCode" -> Clone
<br>
<br>
Once you're in Github, click make sure you select an appropriate device size (I recommend iPhone 12 and up for the best experience). Then, click the play button to run the simulator!
